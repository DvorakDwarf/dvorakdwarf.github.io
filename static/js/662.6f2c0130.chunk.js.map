I've heard Vim cultists rave about how it's the best thing since sliced bread and the transistor, but the final drop was sitting on a call with a person helping me figure out a code problem and seeing them use Vim keybindings. They looked like a wizard and now I wanna do the same. Also ricing. A big part was ricing. Same as with Linux. Entirely because I wanted a pretty desktop.</p>\n        <h2>Making the website itself</h2>\n        <p>I had never touched web anything until about 2 months ago. I was going and checking out other people's websites and decided that the time has come for me to get one of my own. If you are interested search \"FBI no-fly list leak\" and go from there. I won't hide the fact that one of the websites in the webring was a major inspiration for the look of the website. If they find this and get upset, hopefully, they'll finally answer my email months after the fact.</p>\n        <p>I quickly found out I dislike web programming. Everything is different. The HTML/CSS, the javascript monopoly, <a href='https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/'>the frameworks</a>. It just feels like an entirely different activity from the programming I am used to. It's also a lot more visual for my liking. I generally dislike having to draw or make a UI, each activity shaving off a year of my young life. Despite that, HTML was doable. It was surprisingly easy to get over. React, which is what I used for this site, was somehow worse. Brother, how hard can it be to let me read a directory :( I had written the world's smallest backend just to read a directory and then return it to React because it refuses to cooperate otherwise</p>\n        {/* <Codeblock /> */}\n        {/* <span>Sorting by date so that react can pick 2 most recent articles to display on the home page</span> */}\n        <h2>Hosting</h2>\n        <p>Pictured below is the hunk of junk I was planning on keeping this website in. After some intense 10 minutes of googling, I found out it's very much not a recommended thing to do. I briefly looked into different hosting services. I was getting quite tired of making this website so I settled on using Github Pages and it turned out pretty well. Unfortunately, my sad little backend had to be scrapped because it would not work with Github Pages. I ended up making a <code>json</code> containing all relevant info which is not a deal breaker but sad nonetheless</p>\n        <img src={require('./images/PC.jpg')}></img>\n        <span>The door is broken and can't be closed</span>\n        <h2>how do i store file</h2>\n        <p>As a complete noob, for some time I got stuck on how to store the articles. I didn't know whether this is where the backend starts and I get to manage a database or whether I am overthinking. Maybe there is another way of storing it. For example, the developer I took zero inspiration from fetches their posts from cohost which is kinda smart.</p>\n        <p>While I was thinking about this my SSD corrupted and ate all my code.</p>\n        <img src={require('./images/old_website.png')}></img>\n        <span>What could have been</span>\n        <p>I ended up making a folder that contains folders representing articles once I got around to recreating the website. Each article folder has a <code>.jsx</code> for the content of the page, <code>.jsx</code> for the preview on the home page, images used, as well as a <code>meta.json</code> that contains stuff for the article like a date. React reads all that and adjusts the website accordingly as I add more articles which is nice if I don't think about the time I could have saved doing this manually a few times.</p>\n        <p>Overall I am ok with doing web development but the urge to write more rust and anything more low-level is inescapable and insatiable. Or do AI. AI is cool.</p>\n      </main>\n    </article>\n    <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Hi;\n"],"names":["useScrambledTitle","text","_useScramble","useScramble","speed","overdrive","scramble","ref","replay","_jsx","className","onClick","React","meta","require","date","Date","toLocaleDateString","year","month","day","_jsxs","children","Navbar","src","href","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}
