Here is a rough outline: First we create the hexagonal sectors.  For each sector we create a number of stars and make sure that they are not too close to each other.  The type of star is random, but follows roughly the distribution of real star types.  We then create the FTL lanes.  Planets are also randomly created, larger stars have more planets. Depending on the location of the planet we generate the environment factors like size, gravity, albedo, gasseous vs rocky etc.  At the end we distribute resources on the planets.  Me: I am most interested in how nodes (star systems) on the map are generated and connected. Are the stars placed randomly in the hexagon while accounting for proximity with other stars ? Are they connected with FTL lanes just based on how close they are to another star ?  Molp: Yes, the stars are randomly placed, checking everytime that the distance to the existing stars is not too small. The FTL connections are created in two steps. In the first step we create the connections within the sector. To do so, we add a random connection at a time and check a few constraints: Larger suns can have more connections, smaller ones less. Loops are okay. We stop once all stars have a route to all other stars in the sector. Once the sectors have their connections we loop through the sectors and find the closest stars to the neighboring sectors. Again, we randomly connect the sectors and stop once all sectors can reach all other sectors to prevent islands that cannot be reached.
